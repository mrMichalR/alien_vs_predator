# Alien vs Predator
Small image classification - for transfer learning

**About Dataset**

**Context**<br>
Bored with cats vs dogs? Let's try some extraterrestrial beings!

Used in:

- A deepsense.ai blog post Keras vs. PyTorch - Alien vs. Predator recognition with transfer learning in which we compare and contrast Keras and PyTorch approaches.
- Repo with code: github.com/deepsense-ai/Keras-PyTorch-AvP-transfer-learning.
- Free event: upcoming webinar (10 Oct 2018), in which we walk through the code (and you will be able to ask questions).

Alien and Predator images (JPG, various ), for transfer learning. Split into Keras folder structure.

- Format: JPG images, various thumbnail sizes (around 250 x 250 px).
- Volume:
  - train: 247 aliens and 247 predators
  - validation: 100 aliens and 100 predators

**Inspiration**<br>
We wanted to use some new dataset for transfer learning.
